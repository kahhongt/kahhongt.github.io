OpenAI just realised their latest o1 model that is focused on reasoning capabilities, generally substituting immediate next token generation with some reasoning steps introduced before some delayed token generation. This represents a significant 0-1 step-up in LLM capabilities, immediately surpassing beyond Gemini, Claude and other open-sourced models like Llama3 in mathematical and scientific reasoning.

Can't wait to try it out!
