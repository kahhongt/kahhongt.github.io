OpenAI just released the o1 model that is focused on reasoning capabilities, generally substituting immediate next token generation with some reasoning steps introduced before some delayed token generation. This represents a significant 0-1 step-up in LLM capabilities, immediately surpassing beyond Gemini, Claude and other open-sourced models like Llama3 in mathematical and scientific reasoning. Most likely, this model does not represent a foundational model improvement, but rather entails introducing an orchestration layer informed by chain-of-thought reasoning, self-reflection and reinforcement learning. As opposed to zero-shot prompting using the base pretrained model, this means perhaps a factor more number of inference calls for each request. This has interesting implications on the output token cost structures of using AI models with reasoning.

Still, I cannot wait to try it out!
