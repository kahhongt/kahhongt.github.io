I have recently read several articles echoing a similar sentiment: due to the limitations of artificial intelligence, AI will not replace traditional financial analysts anytime soon. One author suggests that human intelligence is still decades ahead of AI in automated fundamental investing. However, despite the confidence seemingly portrayed in these articles, the rationales and empirical evidence provided to support this notion have been weak.

There are two main reasons why this conclusion is surprising. First, this pessimistic outlook contradicts the traditionally optimistic, narrative-driven view of equity analysts. Second, a closer look at the empirical research used to support this notion reveals that the conclusions were drawn by surveying traditional professionals in the financial industry who may know little about AI.

Consider these examples:

1. [**Pessimistic Outlook by Morgan Stanley**](https://fortune.com/2023/05/11/ai-investing-human-guidance-morgan-stanley/)  
   Morgan Stanley surveyed their investors and financial advisors, finding that customers still "prefer a human touch for the time being," with "80% of survey respondents saying AI would never completely replace human guidance."

2. [**Why AI won't replace fund managers and equity analysts anytime soon**](https://valueinvesting.substack.com/p/ainono/)  
   The author presents examples where OpenAI Chat failed to provide research output and concludes that some calculations and insights require "deep industry knowledge" and "significant guidance to produce the desired results." It is astonishing that the conclusion—that AI replacing human financial analysts is "decades away"—was drawn from this superficial usage of the ChatGPT interface.

The value of AI models lies in the orchestration of various contextual, memory, and reasoning components; a zero/single-shot prompting of models was never going to sufficiently consider contextual information and incorporate enough reasoning capability to generate credible market insights.

I strongly believe it is premature to conclude that AI will never be able to replace humans in making effective investment decisions, especially without a clear understanding of where this technology will go. Furthermore, there is a common argument against the use of AI in financial analysis, which is that the technology is not ready for fully independent investment decision making. But who can we expect the making the technology 'ready'? Certainly not OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta, as the foundation models builders cannot be expected to allocate their intellectual or compute resources towards a cause as narrow and self-serving as investment management. As described by Elon Musk, technology does not advance by itself, and can only do so through sincere and thoughtful research over long periods of time. It is up to individuals to make AI ready for investment decision making.

Moreover, research institutions or tech-enabled fund managers have little incentive to broadcast the success of any fully autonomous AI agent in trading, as it risks increasing competition and the alpha being arbitraged away. Thus, even if a model were to work effectively, it would not be publicly acknowledged, as it would quickly cease to work in practice.

Current AI research and data platform companies aim to enhance the abilities of traditional, fundamental fund managers. However, if there is a technical case for an orchestrated AI workflow directly leading to investment decisions, the next frontier for AI in finance becomes clear: a fully autonomous AI-driven research analyst.

Now, this could really be an interesting endeavour for machine learning researchers to work on.
