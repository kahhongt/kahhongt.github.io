Recently I have been reading through a handful of articles echoing a similar vein of thought: That due to the limitations of artificial intelligence, AI will not be able to replace traditional financial analysts anytime soon. According to one author he postulates that human intelligence is still decades ahead of AI automated fundamental investing. However, I have found that despite all the confidence that have been seemingly portrayed in this articles, the rationales for, as well as the empirical evidence provided to support this notion has been incredibly weak.

For them to draw this conclusion has been incredibly surprising for me - for two main reasons. Firstly, this pessimistic outlook contradicts the traditionally optimistic, narrative-driven view of equity analysts. Secondly, when digging deeper into empirical research conducted to support the notion, the conclusion appears to have been conceived by 'surveying' people industry.

Some examples here:
1. [Pessimistic Outlook by Morgan Stanley](https://fortune.com/2023/05/11/ai-investing-human-guidance-morgan-stanley/)

Morgan Stanley surveyed their investors and financial advisors and determined that customers still "prefer a human touch for the time being", and "80% of survey respondents say AI would never completely replace human guidance". Clearly this is flawed surveying, given that these financial advisors have a vested interest in portraying their relevance and thus keeping their jobs.

2. [Why AI won't replace fund managers and equity analysts anytime soon](https://valueinvesting.substack.com/p/ainono/)

The author here showed a few zero-shot prompting examples of how OpenAI Chat failed in providing research output and determined that some calculations and insights required "deep industry knowledge to perform", and that it still requires "significant guidance to produce the desired results". I was flabbergasted by how the author used such a shallow usage of the ChatGPT interface to draw the conclusion that AI replacing humans is "decades away". Surely the value of such models lie in the orchestration of various contextual, memory and reasoning components; a zero/single-shot prompting of models was never going to cut it. Also it turned out that the author is also a fundamental equity analyst.


I believe it is way, way too early to make this conclusion that AI will never be able to replace humans in making an effective investment decisions, especially without sufficient knowledge of where this technology will go. Additionally, it is also not difficult to imagine that for traditional financial analysts or portfolio managers who have spent years or decades selling their time to make a decent living, it can be challenging to accept that this prospect represents fundamental upheaval in their propriety and self-worth.

In the process of compiling more articles to critic. More on this.
