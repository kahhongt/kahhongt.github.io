Note to self to pursue convex value-creating opportunities. Convex opportunities are those that produce disproportionately outsized return per unit of marginal effort over time. Anecdotically, what this can mean is that if we are creating 1 unit of value per unit effort in Year 1, a convex opportunity should result in 25 units of value, in any shape or form, per unit effort by Year 5, instead of just 5 units of value. Identifying convex opportunities can be challenging; it can be due to a mix of both exogenous and endogenous variables including various technical, regulatory and market dynamics, state of technology, location, and point in time.

The most successful technological companies today are all convex opportunities: Meta, Amazon, and Google all have strong network effects that scale exponentially with each additional platform user. In other cases, like in the case of Stripe, with fixed cost invested in research and development their technological stack can accommodate exponentially more users while the cost base mainly consisting of engineering talent costs scales linearly. This means % margins grow exponentially. OpenAI benefits from a similar dynamic even more so when their cloud and compute resources are further scaled with their Microsoft partnership; but their training regimes are also bolstered over time by the creation of more content available for training on the internet.

Hedge fund careers have clear drivers of convexity in terms of financial rewards - mainly figuratively, but sometimes also literally. Highly successful portfolio managers scale their returns from robust performance, but their track record also begets stronger sales for their offerings, enabling them to raise AUM. Even if each of these individual processes are intrinsically linear in return, their clear, mathematical, multiplicative effects make the entire dynamic convex. For some capacity-constained strategies, however, having more to manage adds a slight dampening effect onto the performance process directly; thus there is an optimisation problem to be solved for. This primarily explains why many highly successful funds always seem to be closed to new investors.

More thoughts on this to come.
