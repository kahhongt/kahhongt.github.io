It has been almost 2 years since I graduated from college. I curiously dabbled in finance for a short while as though I had something to prove, before returning back to work in data science. Like how some linguistic experts claim that being bilingual from a young age helps to keep the child more open-minded towards different cultures, I strongly believe in the benefits of pursuing multiple domains concurrently, because life would be too boring if we do only one thing at a time. At the moment, I am a data scientist specialising in product analytics, which entails the use of experimentation and statistics to make critical product decisions - think A/B testing, statistical modelling, insights generation. An emerging field which did not exist more than 5 years ago in Southeast Asia, analytics work requires a technology stack accorded only to mature companies with more developed data infrastructure and with engineering resources to build experimentation platforms. While commonplace in mature technology hubs like Silicon Valley and Shen Zhen, I would not say that product analytics is a critical research function for most technology start-ups, as there are logical and domain constraints which inhibit adoption:
1. Scale: The service must receive data with sufficient volume (in the range of millions of clickstream events per day)
2. Industry: As an indirect requirement of achieving scale, companies with product analytics functions tend to be consumer facing, with millions of daily active users. For enterprise-facing companies like Slack or Atlassian, qualitative user research and intuition would tend to be sufficient to obtain actionable feedback to product
3. Cost: A dedicated data engineering and internal tools product team would typically be required to develop and maintain data infrastructure for insights generation. This is a luxury that most early stage startups would not be able to afford.
