It has been almost 2 years since I graduated from college. I curiously dabbled in finance for a short while as though I had something to prove, before returning back to work in data science. Like how some linguistic experts claim that being bilingual from a young age helps to inculcate greater open-mindedness towards different cultures, I strongly believe in the benefits of pursuing multiple domains concurrently, because life would be too boring if we do only one thing at a time. At the moment, I am a data scientist specialising in product analytics, which entails the use of experimentation and statistics to make critical product decisions - think A/B testing, statistical modelling, insights generation, etc.

Wikipedia provides a good infographic illustrating a common use case for A/B experimentation:

More often than not, A/B testing involves far more than superficial UI changes. It may be used to test variations in search/ranking algorithms, entire user experience flows, product pricing, and even for evaluating system performance and stability. Analytics work requires a technology stack accorded only to mature companies with more developed data infrastructure and sufficient engineering resources to build experimentation platforms. While commonplace in mature technology hubs like Silicon Valley and Shen Zhen, I would not say that product analytics is a critical research function for most technology start-ups, as there are valid logical and domain constraints inhibiting adoption:

1. Scale: The service must receive sufficient data beyond a threshold volume (in the range of millions of clickstream events per day) to make infrastructure investments worthwhile. Each analytics-driven decision should drive financial impact of at least millions of dollars.
2. Industry: As an indirect requirement of achieving scale, companies with product analytics functions tend to be consumer facing, with millions of daily active users. Enterprise-facing companies like Slack or Atlassian would have found qualitative user research and intuition sufficient to obtain actionable feedback to product.
3. Cost: A dedicated data engineering and internal tools product team would typically be required to develop and maintain data infrastructure for insights generation. This is a luxury that most early stage, inadequately-funded startups would not be able to afford.
