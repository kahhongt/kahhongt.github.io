Learnt an inspirational quote from Sam Altman today: Inaction is an insiduous form of risk. Only by moving forward can we see and explore the wide universe of opportunities ahead. Have found myself starting to appreciate the complexity of risk management in personal or career decision making; a state of action or inaction both involves accepting a level of risk, and have therefore decided to restructure the problem into 2 concepts: Action and Conviction.

In my framework I postulate that the optimal course of action and state of mind in any scenario (personal, professional or otherwise) often lies in two extremes: either aggressive action taken towards a path of conviction, or inaction where there is a lack of conviction. It was tempting to explore an MBA-style 2x2 axis to professionally illustrate the point:

| | **Aggressive Action** | **Gross Inaction** |
| :---------------- |:------:|:----:|
| **Strong Conviction**|1. Optimal State with Momentum, Not Regrettable|2. Lack of Execution, Unproductive, Regrettable|
| **Weak Conviction**|3. Misdirected Productive Effort, Regrettable |4. Unproductive, Not Regrettable|

We see that only in 2 cases whereby the decision becomes non-regrettable: Strong Conviction + Aggressive Action, and Weak Conviction + Gross Inaction. This is not to say that the Inaction + Weak Conviction cases necessarily leads to a worse outcome than the former case. This framework pertains to a certain deterministic course of action that has been identified, and the lack of productive effort invested in an activity without conviction actually means mental and time resources could have been committed elsewhere with greater probability of success.

The main problem lies in the middle, where there is either a lack of conviction or a lack of action. These two states lead to regrettable outcomes in different ways, but it is easy to imagine the majority of adults in this category. Some examples below:

2. **Lack of Execution**: Procrastination; inability to act, lack of willingness/courage to act; giving excuses for inaction; fear of external consequences, etc  
3. **Misdirected Effort**: Trapped in a career without identifiable long-term prospects; doing work on another's direction; disagreement with team decision, etc

One could then argue that State (2) is a redundant case: assuming all humans are capable of acting on intent, surely this just means when there is gross inaction, there has to be a lack of sufficient conviction? Maybe there is some conviction, but due to one or multiple reasons, the level of conviction is insufficient to garner the courage or resources to pursue the desired course of action. Hence, as long as this assumptionn holds, there should only be 3 states, not 4.

State 3 is interesting because it surfaces the fact that conviction as a concept is multi-layered and multi-faceted. Do many people inspire to be doctors because they possess high conviction towards becoming a doctor? Or could it be due to their desire to save lives? Some may have strong convictions because they want to earn a decent living, or make their parents and community proud? A wide variety of convictions and reasons can lead to the same course of action of (becoming a doctor), but clearly the level of regret differs based on circumstances. What happens when there is suddenly a huge supply of trained doctors in the market leading to a fall in wages for doctors? Why would some doctors then decide to leave to pursue something more lucrative, and what would be the reasons why others would remain in the field?

This means understanding the composition of one's conviction towards a specific goal is critical. More on this.
