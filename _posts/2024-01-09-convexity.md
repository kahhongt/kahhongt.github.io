Understand the intrinsic convexity of opportunities. Convex opportunities are those that produce increasing return per unit of marginal effort over time. Here, return and value are intentionally ambiguously defined, and they could be any notion ranging from value to the customer, financial return, number of goods sold, new knowledge, etc. Identifying convex opportunities can be challenging; it can be due to a mix of both exogenous and endogenous variables including various technical, regulatory and market dynamics, state of technology, location, and point in time.

The most successful technological companies today are all engaged in convex dynamics: Meta, Amazon, and Google all have strong network effects that scale exponentially with each additional platform user. In other cases, like in the case of Stripe, with fixed cost invested in research and development their technological stack can accommodate exponentially more users while the cost base mainly consisting of engineering talent costs scales linearly. This means % margins grow exponentially. OpenAI benefits from a similar dynamic even more so when their cloud and compute resources are further scaled with their Microsoft partnership; but their training regimes are also bolstered over time by the creation of more content available for training on the internet. In such businesses, there is either a greater increment of value per unit user, a decreasing cost per unit user onboarded onto the platform, or both.

More thoughts on this to come.
