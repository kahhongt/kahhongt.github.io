Peter Thiel: Competition as Validation. It may be tempting to squeeze through the narrow door that everyone is trying to get into, but take a step back and instead look around the corner and explore the vast, empty gate that no one is paying attention to. It is unthinkable that in many perceivably esteemed career paths the degree of competition has become so fierce when the stakes are so low. The intention is not to insinuate a lifestyle lacking in competition, and thus lacking in ambition. While thriving to succeed in a highly competitive space may indicate some level of ambition, the reverse is not true.
