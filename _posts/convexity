Note to self to only pursue convex opportunities. Convex opportunities are those that produce disproportionately outsized return per unit of marginal effort over time. Anecdotically, what this can mean is that if we are creating 1 unit of value per unit time in Year 1, a convex opportunity should result in 25 units of value per unit time by Year 5, instead of just 5 units of value.
