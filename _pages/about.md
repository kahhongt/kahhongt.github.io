Hi! I am Kah Hong, a data scientist serving some hungry folks in Southeast Asia. I am currently focused on statistical modelling and product experimentation, but have just enough expertise in machine learning and optimisation concepts to work on impactful projects. Particularly, I am interested in the modelling of time series and geographical trends for a myriad of use cases - ranging from product analytics, social sciences, and quantitative research in finance.

I am creating this website to showcase some projects I will be working on - it is also a platform for me to learn to illustrate data insights in a way that is wholesome and palatable.

### Contact
I can be contacted at kahhong.tai[at]gmail.com

### Site Details
This website template was forked from https://academicpages.github.io/, which in turn was forked from https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/.
