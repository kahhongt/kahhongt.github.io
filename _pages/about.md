# Welcome

Hi! I am Kah Hong, a data scientist serving some hungry folks in Southeast Asia. I am currently focused on statistical modelling and product experimentation, but I have just enough expertise in machine learning and optimisation concepts to work on impactful projects. Particularly, I am interested in the modelling of time series and geographical trends for a myriad of use cases.

I am creating this website to showcase some projects I will be working on - it is also a platform for me to learn to illustrate data insights in a way that is wholesome and palatable. I hope you enjoy your visit!
