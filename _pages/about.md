Hi! I am Kah Hong! I am currently a Quantitative Researcher based in Geneva, Switzerland. I was previously a Data Scientist in London, UK. I am interested in probabilistics modelling, machine learning and analytical solutions to inference problems in consumer technology, social phenomena, and the financial markets. I gravitate towards developing solutions with long-term stability and reliability in mind, and learn by breaking down problems and understanding technical concepts from first principles.

Lake KÃ¶nigssee, Germany

One of the most enchanting places I have ever visited in Europe, and it remained very impressionable to me till this day.
