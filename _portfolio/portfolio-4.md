### Background
According to Investopedia, Statistical Arbitrage regers to trading strategies that utilise mean-reversion to invest in diverse portfolios, over both short and medium time horizons. A statistical arbitrage portfolio would typically be intended to be market neutral, due to the presence of both long and short positions in highly-correlated assets. While statistical arbitrage is typically used on trading pairs, the concept may also be applied to groups of correlated securities. For greater simplicity and interpretability we will be limiting analyses only to a pair of cryptocurrencies.

### Identifying Pairs for Mean-Reversion
There are a few core criteria for selecting appropriate trading pairs:
1. High Correlation
2. High Cointegration
3. Stationarity of Price Spread/Ratio

While not strictly assuming a linear model, a high degree of correlation and cointegration is required to ensure that the two assets move in tandem, thereby allowing the overall portfolio to be approximately market neutral.
